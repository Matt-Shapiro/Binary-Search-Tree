# Binary-Search-Tree
Simple Binary Search Tree with insert/remove/find

Driver class tests the runtime complexity of the find() function in two cases:

One case is when the elements are inserted in ascending order. In this case the runtime complexity is O(n).

The other case is when the elements are inserted in random order. In this case the runtime complexity is O(log(n))

The test is run on Trees with 100,000 elements, 75,000 elements, and 50,000 elements
